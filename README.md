# HackathonWork
Features the HTML/CSS (and digital illustration) work I did for two hackathons in 2016 and 2017. Pardon the old code! I've modified these files slightly to address some minor code formatting nitpicks, but they are otherwise untouched from their original forms. 

## About the two projects
This repo features Can I Eat That? and Make Up My Mind. Here, I've put only the work I've done on these projects. Can I Eat That? is an Amazon Alexa app and Twitter bot, and the webpage I created served as a quick explanation of what the app is and where you can find it. It was created for the 2017 Chicago Hacks hackathon. Make Up My Mind was conceived as a site where users could pose their dilemma and the community could vote for and discuss two different options. The page I made served as a mockup of what the final product would look like, which was a 1:1 recreation of a page concept I made in Photoshop. This project was made for a small hackathon I attended in late 2016.
